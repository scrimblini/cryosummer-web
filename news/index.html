                <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hello! First of all, thanks to everyone for keeping up with this project. I would like to elaborate about how this whole thing came to be in the first place:
                <br>
                The story itself dates back to 2018 when i first started thinking about this concept. At the time, I had been receiving help from a friend to write the story, though quickly our paths diverged and we each ended up making different but similar stories. The plot of mine (this game) changed a lot since then, but you can check out my friend's work Here(extlink). Their work is also vaguely complementary to this story, so id recommend checking it out when either project is finished!
                <br>
                That aside, it means I have been working on this story for over 6 years. Here are some things that changed:
                <br>
                Initially, I had planned this to be in the format of an animated webseries or a webcomic. Though an animated series sounds cool, it would require extra effort and I'm not that good at animating or at managing my own time. the webcomic idea still remained in my head but it never really came to be, cramming detailed scenes into small panels also seemed really tedious. I figured that a more fun way to put this story would be by making it into a game, even though i even get a little self conscious about my skills regarding that sometimes. but one day, i can hope that itll be finally polished and ready for the public.
                <br>
                Until then, I'll keep you guys updated as long as you choose to subscribe or follow any of the social media listed <a>here</a>.
